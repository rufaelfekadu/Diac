## Abstract
Automatic text-based diacritic restoration models generally have high diacritic error rates when applied to speech transcripts as a result of domain and style shifts in spoken language. In this work, we explore the possibility of improving the performance of automatic diacritic restoration when applied to speech data by utilizing parallel spoken utterances. In particular, we use the pre-trained Whisper ASR model fine-tuned on relatively small amounts of diacritized Arabic speech data to produce rough diacritized transcripts for the speech utterances, which we then use as an additional input for diacritic restoration models. The proposed framework consistently improves diacritic restoration performance compared to text-only baselines. Our results highlight the inadequacy of current text-based diacritic restoration models for speech data sets and provide a new baseline for speech-based diacritic restoration.


## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rufaelfekadu/Diac
cd Diacritization
conda create -n diac python=3.12
conda activate diac
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📁 Data Preparation

### 1. Prepare Input Data

Run the following to download and prepare the CLArTTS data

```bash 
python prep_clartts.py
```

The script generates a .tsv file for train and test splits of the dataset

## 🧠 Models

To train the models, use the following command. Choose the 
```bash
python train.py --config configs/transformer.clartts.yml # path to the configuration file
```

To Run inference update the test_path and output_path in the configuration yaml file and run the following.
test_path can be one of the following:
- `data.tsv`: tsv file with format (audio_paths \t undiacritized_text) or (undiacritized_text \t ASR_output)
- `data.txt`: lines of undiacritized text

```bash
python inference.py --config configs/transformer.clartts.yml
```
This will create a text file with the predicted values at output_path. To run the evaluation use

```bash
python eval.py -ofp /path/to/original-text -tfp /path/to/target-text
```
